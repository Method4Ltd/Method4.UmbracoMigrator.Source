# Method4.UmbracoMigrator.Source - Roadmap

This is a list of outstanding features, that will be actioned as and when we need them.
Feel free to submit a PR if you need them sooner.

---

- Snapshot Export options
    - Add the ability to select/deselect all nodes, rather than just the root nodes.
- General
    - Move snapshot generation to a background thread to prevent the UI from timing out during a large job.
    - Add some logic to disable the snapshot generate button whilst a snapshot generation is in progress.
